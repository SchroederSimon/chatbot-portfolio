Chatbot Portfolio is a web application that I developed using HTML, CSS, TypeScript, React, Vite, and coHere API.
The application serves as a chatbot that answers questions about me, providing information that can be used to create a more engaging and informative portfolio.

The chatbot works by using natural language processing to interpret user input and generate responses based on a pre-determined set of responses. 
The HERE API is used to provide location-based information about me, such as my current city or the location of my favorite coffee shop.
